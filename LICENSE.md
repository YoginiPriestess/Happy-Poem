Nothing can make me happy just me just me just me 
nothing makes me happy except for Me Myself and I

Nothing make me happy just me just me just me 
nothing makes me happy except for Me Myself

You can make me happier 
Doing your happy dance 
You make me happyer 
Sharing happy joyous romance 
You make me happier 
Creating our living in bliss 
You make me happier 
When all of us get our wish 
Happy benevolent kiss

Nothing can make me happy just me just me just me 
nothing makes me happy except for Me Myself and I
Nothing can make me happy just me just me just me 
nothing makes me happy except for Me Myself and I

Happy Chi energy flow through all of me
